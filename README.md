# krisenkas

## Quickstart

This is a new beginning

To install all dependencies run:

    yarn

To build and run locally:

    yarn start

## Before you start

Create an *.env.development* file like *.env.example* and get the values from the firebase settings site from the project [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/krisenkas/settings/general/).

>Note: If there is an firebase error in the console, first stop the start script and then delete the .cache folder. After that start again and all environment variables should have been picked up.
